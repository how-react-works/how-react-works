"React工作原理"是一个由[苏溪云](https://terry-su.github.io)创建用来讲React(版本: 16.8.4)实现原理的网站。  

<0>One of the author's favorite technology stacks is React, which long ago decided to figure out its internal implementation and use it more freely. After a long period of research, including reading all the documents on the React official website, reading relevant articles and materials, reading and debugging the React source code, I sorted them into documents and released them on the Internet. If you like this website, welcome to follow and collect. More React related content (Hooks, React Router, etc.) will be updated later.</0>

整站文档将以先整体再局部、简明概要的结构展现所有内容。值得注意的是，文档不会涉及react-native，而是通过更为常用的react-dom来展现原理。

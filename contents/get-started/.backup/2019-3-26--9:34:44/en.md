<2>"How React Works" is a docs website demonstrating the internal works of React(version: <@version/>) by [Terry Su](https://terry-su.github.io).</2>  

<0>One of the author's favorite technology stacks is React, which long ago decided to figure out its internal implementation and use it more freely. After a long period of research, including reading all the documents on the React official website, reading relevant articles and materials, reading and debugging the React source code, I sorted them into documents and released them on the Internet. If you like this website, welcome to follow and collect. More React related content (Hooks, React Router, etc.) will be updated later.</0>

<1>The site documentation will be presented as a whole, then as a partial, concise overview of the structure of all content. Notably, the document does not deal with react-native, but rather presents the principles through the more commonly used react-dom.</1>
